# BCH JS

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/christroutner/bch-js.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

- [npm library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@chris.troutner/bch-js)

This is an [ECMAScript 2017 JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript#8th_Edition_-_ECMAScript_2017) fork of
the [BITBOX SDK](https://github.com/Bitcoin-com/bitbox-sdk) maintained
by Bitcoin.com. It was forked 5/9/19 just prior to the v7.0.0 release of
BITBOX-SDK.
This fork removes bable, typescript, and
flow as dependencies. The code base is pure JavaScript, tested against
[node.js v10 LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/).
This removes the time-lag in compiling the library and also means that error messages
will indicate the actual lines of code (helpful), rather than lines in the
compiled output (less helpful).

I created this fork because I think many JavaScript developers are unwilling to
learn TypeScript, or simply hate compiled back-end apps like I do. This
repository is for
these marginalized developers. This fork will be maintained by
me ([Chris Troutner](https://memo.cash/profile/1NpYaazpQ26KrMTeFf66zVKy6x9KzcLgTA)) as
a hobby. There will most likely be a big lag when it comes to porting new
features in BITBOX to this repository.

Whereas BITBOX SDK has a big focus on integrating the latest features in the
the ecosystem, this BITBOX JS fork will remain relatively stable, integrating
new features at a much slower pace.

Major features of this fork:
- Pure, standard, uncompiled JavaScript
- [Semantic Release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) for
continuous delivery using semantic versioning.
- [Greenkeeper](https://greenkeeper.io/) automatic dependency management for
automatically maintaining the latest, most secure dependencies.
- [IPFS uploads](https://ipfs.io) of all files and dependencies, to backup
dependencies in case they are ever inaccessible from GitHub or npm.

## IPFS Releases

I will periodically publish IPFS releases of this repository, including all
dependencies in the `node_modules` folder. This ensures working copies of this
repository can be retrieved in case there is any drift in dependency files, or
if dependencies are pulled from npm or GitHub.
